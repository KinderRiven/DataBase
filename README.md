malbrain/database
==========================

A working project for High-concurrency B-tree/Database source code in C.

Compile with ./build or build.bat

The runtime options are:

    Usage: dbtest db_name -cmds=[crwsdf]... -type=[012] -bits=# -xtra=# -onDisk -txns -noDocs -keyLen=# src_file1 src_file2 ... ]
      where db_name is the prefix name of the database file
      cmds is a string of (c)ount/(r)ev scan/(w)rite/(s)can/(d)elete/(f)ind, with a one character command for each input src_file, or a no-input command.
      type is the type of index: 0 = ART, 1 = btree1, 2 = btree2
      keyLen is key size, zero for whole line
      bits is the btree page size in bits
      xtra is the btree leaf page extra bits
      onDisk specifies resides in disk file
      noDocs specifies keys only
      txns indicates use of transactions
      src_file1 thru src_filen are files of keys/documents separated by newline

Linux compilation command:

    [karl@test7x64 xlink]# cc -O2 -g -o dbtest standalone.c db*.c artree/*.c btree1/*.c -lpthread
