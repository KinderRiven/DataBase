This is an advanced btree implementation that doesn't use page locks.  The keys on each page are kept in a skip list.  Each page has a logical page number which are object ID indexes, and indirect through the objectID arrays which store the physical file address for the page.  When the page fills two new pages are split from the original full page with their logical page numbers and fence keys installed in the next page level closer to the root. The original full page is then retired.
