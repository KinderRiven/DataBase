This is an advanced btree implementation that doesn't use page locks.  The keys on each page are stored from the end of the page downwards, with their page offsets organized into a skip list. Each page has a logical page number which are object IDs, and indirect through the objectID slots to retrieve the page's physical file address.  When a page fills two new pages are split from the original full page with their logical page numbers and fence keys installed in the next higher level closer to the root. The original full page is then retired.
